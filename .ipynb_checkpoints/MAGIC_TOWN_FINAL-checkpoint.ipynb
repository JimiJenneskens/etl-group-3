    "# Impact in tourism and economy of the “PUBLOS MÁGICOS” program.\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The *“Pueblos Mágicos”* program has the objective to transform Mexico, around the 2030, in a leading country in tourism activity. To achieve this, the government proposed as a strategy to recognize tourism as a key element in Mexico's economic development. Diversify tourism products and develop new markets. Promote tourism companies to be competitive nationally and internationally. Develop tourism while respecting natural, cultural and social environments, in this context the program *“Pueblos Mágicos”* was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acording to the **SECTUR**, a magical town (“pueblo mágico”) is a locality that has symbolic attributes, legends, history, transcendent facts, everyday life, etc. In short, they possess magic that appears in each one of their socio cultural manifestations, and today they can be perceived as a great opportunity for tourist use. The Magical Towns Program contributes to revalue a group of populations in the country that have always been in the collective imagination of the nation as a whole and that represent fresh and different alternatives for national and foreign visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposal of an ETL project\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the main objective of this program is to convert Mexico in leading country on tourism, then it is necessary to create a unique database that captures how does this program has impacted the different localities that has access to this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so several data sources has to be consulted and aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe actual list of localities considered as Magic town.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tIts contribution to the gross domestic product associated with the Tourism activity at the state and national level since the creation of the first magic town (this info is available yearly)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tAn indirect measurement of the success could be the variation in the number of hotels and hostels per year in each Magic Town, to do so web scraping is required\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tAlso, it could be important to characterize the weather in each Magic town, in order to do a further analysis about the impact of this variable on the success of the program en each Magic Town\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tIf possible  extract the main festivities or attractive of each Magic town through web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Information availability:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tList of magical towns with its creation date.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a csv file available at: https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/localidades-que-cuentan-con-el-nombramiento-de-pueblo-magico-dggd.  The csv contains three columns which are: “State”, “Locality”, “year”.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tThe gross domestic product \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a csv file available at the INEGI, in the “Banco de información económica”. It is importat to use constant pesos in order to have comparable quatities. Info is available at: https://www.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/bie/\n",
    "The query returns a table with a column that encrypts all the info about the state, the and the economic activity, and a column for each required year. The query is exportable as an html, or csv, or xml file.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tThe weather in each magic town\n",
    "To extract the weather main variable such as mean temperature, cloudinees, etc a web api could be used. However, sicnce there is not enough time we use the statal mean  anual temperatures (max, min, avg) and the statal mean precipitation in $mm/{m^3}$.\n",
    "Each weather variable for the 2000-2018 years are available in an excel file (*i.e.* there are 80 excel files). Each one has 14 columns, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The first column has the state variable\n",
    "    * From the second thirtenth column the weather variable for each month of the year\n",
    "    * The last column has the anual mean weather variable\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.\tCity hotels\n",
    "In this case a web scraping in a cite of hotels has to be done for each of 113 (more or less) magic towns. It is suggested a google query. This is not done yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tMagic town characteristics\n",
    "This could be done through a web scraping in the web site: http://www.sectur.gob.mx/gobmx/pueblos-magicos/. This is not done yet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology:\n",
    "The methodology consists on seven steps, described bellow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tVisit the corresponding web pages and if necessary, design the queries\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Clean the data bases where necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tCreate and data base diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tWhere necessary create an sql database\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tWhere necessary create a no sql db\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tExport everything in pyhton\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tJoin info in different tables or in one table as desired.\n"
